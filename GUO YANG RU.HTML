There is a saying that "getting together is fate".  Since we met in DJI by fate, we hope that we can get to know each other and become friends in the future.  Hope we can continue to encourage each other and grow together.  We have the deepest flower season and rainy season.  I am also very happy to be a partner fighting side by side with everyone.  I hope that everyone will help each other and make progress together in the future study and work.</i></p>

                <h3><P>In order to bring a better user experience, DJI has raised the efficiency of the power system and noise control to a new level. The ESC of the "Royal" Mavic Pro Platinum Edition adopts the FOC sine wave drive architecture, which makes the motor commutation transition smoother and reduces electromagnetic noise.<br> The noise improves the overall efficiency of the motor and ESC at the same time, and the 8331 propeller completely reconstructs its aerodynamic shape, which not only further improves the aerodynamic efficiency, but also significantly reduces the aerodynamic noise. <br>The data is in an ideal indoor environment , measured at a distance of 1 meter from the aircraft</P></h3>

                <h3><p style="color:rgb(242, 113, 21)"><i> Provides 30 minutes of additional flight time.

                    Professional-level aerial photography requires sufficient battery life.  The maximum flight time of the Phantom 4 Pro is about 30 minutes, allowing you to capture more footage with ease every time you take off and land.  The DJI GO app will calculate the remaining power and flight time based on the flight distance, and prompt you to return in advance.  The advanced power management system protects the battery from charging and discharging, and automatically discharges the battery during long-term storage to ensure safer and more durable use</i></p>
