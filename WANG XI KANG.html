<h3><p style="color:OrangeRed;"><i>At first glance, I fell in love with it; the perfectly contoured design and the impressive inverted seagull wing design were deeply embedded in my mind. I tried to build my first model aircraft that could be loaded with electronics and batteries. My first experience of flying my electric plane remains an unforgettable memory for me as I experienced dozens of failures before it was broadcast. I think many children with the same dream would find it difficult to achieve this goal and would not have enough time and money to achieve an independently designed plane in the sky.</i></p></h3>
<br>         
<h3><p><i> We will provide high-quality and effective flying education for all customers. We insanely focused on customer’s experience, our staff were highly instructed and professional for teaching everyone how to fly and using our products. We would like to introduce our classes. There are four parts of the procedure to master flying skills: theoretically  knowing how to fly, practically experiencing flight, enhancing operating control, and advanced creation of nice and wonderful images and videos.  </i></p></h3>
